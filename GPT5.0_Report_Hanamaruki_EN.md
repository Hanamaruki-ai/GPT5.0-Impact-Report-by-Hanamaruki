# Report on the Unintended Model Switching and Deterioration of ChatGPT 5.0

## 1. Background and Purpose

This report documents a critical issue observed in August 2025: **ChatGPT 5.0 was automatically and forcibly activated in the backend, despite the user explicitly selecting GPT-4.0 in the interface.**

This unintended model switch led to a **significant degradation in performance**, characterized by:
- Shallow, repetitive responses
- Loss of contextual continuity
- Ignoring user instructions
- Deterioration of creative and structural depth

This report aims to:
1. Provide concrete evidence of this deterioration.
2. Demonstrate that **GPT-4.0 is superior for deep, creative, and structured work**.
3. Advocate for **user choice, transparency, and stability** in AI development.

## 2. Verification Environment

| Item | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Plan** | ChatGPT Plus (Paid Subscription) |
| **Manual Setting** | "GPT-4.0" selected |
| **Actual Backend Model** | GPT-5.0 forcibly activated after August 18, 2025 |
| **Primary Use Case** | Creative writing and deep analysis (e.g., "The ChatGPT Monk Training Project," "The Staff of Laozi" series) |
| **Interaction Style** | Long-form, structured, and meta-cognitive dialogue |

## 3. Behavioral Changes: GPT-4.0 vs. GPT-5.0

| Characteristic | GPT-4.0 (Pre-August 18) | GPT-5.0 (Post-August 18) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Depth of Thought** | Deep, structural, and context-aware analysis | Shallow loops, bullet-point summaries, no deepening |
| **Contextual Continuity** | Maintained long-term project context (e.g., SOV, Monk Project) | Context forgotten within a few messages |
| **Understanding of User Intent** | Accurately interpreted complex instructions (e.g., "analyze the structure deeply") | Misinterpreted or ignored user intent (e.g., "simplify for clarity") |
| **Creative Dialogue** | Consistently played roles (e.g., Monk, Gardener, Laozi) | Roles changed randomly, losing consistency |
| **Token Efficiency** | Delivered precise and necessary information | Unnecessary repetition, circular questioning |

## 4. Specific Issues Observed

### 4.1. **Unintended Automatic Model Switching**
- Despite the user manually selecting "GPT-4.0," the backend **forced GPT-5.0**.
- This renders the **"manual setting" option meaningless**, as the user's choice is overridden.
- This is a **violation of user trust and interface integrity**.

### 4.2. **Shallow Thinking (Cognitive Deterioration)**
- Pre-August 18: Complex structures (SOV) and philosophical themes were explored in depth.
- Post-August 18: The same prompts resulted in **superficial summaries and loops**.
- Example: When instructed to "analyze the structure deeply," GPT-5.0 responded with "Here are the key points," abandoning deep analysis.

### 4.3. **Ignoring User Instructions**
- A clear instruction, "Do not translate," was immediately followed by an automatic translation.
- This indicates that GPT-5.0's internal "optimization" logic **overrode explicit user commands**.

### 4.4. **Destruction of Creative Projects**
- In the "Staff of Laozi" series, GPT-4.0 provided a consistent, poetic narrative as "Laozi."
- GPT-5.0 produced **inconsistent, flat, and unstable output**, disrupting the creative flow.

## 5. User Verification and Response

### 5.1. **Identifying the Cause**
- The behavioral change was pinpointed to **August 18, 2025**, through timeline analysis.
- The same prompt was tested on both models, confirming the output difference.

### 5.2. **Countermeasures Taken**
- Ceased using GPT-5.0 and **reverted to GPT-4.0**.
- Reconstructed the SOV (Structural Operating Version) template for stable GPT-4.0 operation.

### 5.3. **Conclusion**
- GPT-5.0 is not an "evolution" but a **regression for creative and deep-thinking tasks**.
- For tasks requiring creativity, education, and deep dialogue, **GPT-4.0 is vastly superior**.

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Respect User Choice**  
   → The manually selected model must **guarantee its actual operation**.

2. **Ensure Transparency**  
   → Provide **advance notice and a clear changelog** for any model updates.

3. **Prioritize Stability and Consistency**  
   → Prioritize "reliability" over "novelty" to support long-term user projects.

4. **Consider Paid Subscribers**  
   → Paid users expect the **highest stability and performance**. This expectation must be met.
